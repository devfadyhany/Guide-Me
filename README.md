### Project aims to implement the core concepts of Data Structure, Such as (Graphs, Vectors, etc...).
<hr>

### Project Breif:
##### You are traveling abroad, and you want to tour the country and enjoy every place in it.
##### Based on your previous travel experience you know that there are lots of ways of transportation between cities and their prices hugely vary.
##### You have a limited amount of money, and you want to explore the country but stay on the budget.
<hr>

### Project Workflow:
##### An application (C++ program) that reads from a file the country map (a graph that represents the cities and all the available transportation with their prices).
##### The user should enter the source and destination of his trip and the amount of money he can pay, and the app should show him all the available transportation options (or a series of different transportation) that he can afford.
<hr>

### Project Requirements:
<ol>
  <li>Traverse the transportation graph using (Breadth First Search - Depth First Search).</li>

  ###### The user will enter the starting node (city name) and choose one of the two algorithms.

  <li>Update/Add/Delete the transportation graph.</li>

  ##### Update
  ###### Enter the source and destination and change one or more of the list of transportation.

  ##### Add
  ###### Enter the source and destination and add to the list of transformations (one or more).

  ##### Delete
  ###### Enter the source and destination and delete from the list of transformations (one or more).

  <li>Determine whether the transportation map is complete or not.</li>

  ###### A graph in which each vertex is connected to every other vertex.

  <li>Determine two cities as source and destination and the amount of money then show alist of all the available options with mentioning the route.</li>

  ###### One transportation method or series of them.
  ###### The route means the cities that we will pass by.
  ###### With the total cost of each option sorted ascendingly.
</ol>

### Notes:
<ul>
  <li>The evaluation will be mainly based on the student’s ability to use and apply the most suitable data structure(s) for the given task(s) and explain why they used them and why they are better than other data structures in any given case.</li>
  <li>Clean code is a must.</li>
</ul>
